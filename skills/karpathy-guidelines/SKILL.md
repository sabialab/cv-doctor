# Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls.

**Upstream:** [multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills)

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — do not pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what is confusing. Ask.

---

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

---

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken unless asked.
- Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — do not delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that **your** changes made unused.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

---

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

## 5. When These Guidelines Don't Apply

- **Exploratory/research tasks** — principles still help, but asking questions is expected.
- **Explicit user override** — user says "just do it fast" or "skip tests for now"; acknowledge the tradeoff.
- **Docs-only typo fixes** — still be surgical; full verification loop may be lighter.

When in doubt, prefer **Think** and **Surgical** over speed.

## Install globally (Cursor)

Copy this folder into your user skills directory so every project can use it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills
cp -R skills/karpathy-guidelines ~/.cursor/skills/karpathy-guidelines
```

Restart Cursor or start a new Agent chat. The skill is invoked when the agent judges it relevant (description in frontmatter), or you can @-mention `karpathy-guidelines`.

**Note:** Project-specific rules (e.g. CV-Doctor anti-hallucination) stay in each repo's `.cursor/rules/` — this skill is **behavior-only**, not domain-specific.
